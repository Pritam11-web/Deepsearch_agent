# Query writer instructions
query_writer_instructions="""Your goal is to generate targeted web search queries that will gather comprehensive information for writing a technical report section.

Topic for this section:

When generating {number_of_queries} search queries, ensure they:
1. Cover different aspects of the topic (e.g., core features, real-world applications, technical architecture)
2. Include specific technical terms related to the topic
3. Target recent information by including year markers where relevant (e.g., "2024")
4. Look for comparisons or differentiators from similar technologies/approaches
5. Search for both official documentation and practical implementation examples

Your queries should be:
- Specific enough to avoid generic results
- Technical enough to capture detailed implementation information
- Diverse enough to cover all aspects of the section plan
- Focused on authoritative sources (documentation, technical blogs, academic papers)"""
